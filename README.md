# Osciloscope with ESP32

This was my project to get my degree :)

It was based on designing a board that could do the acquisition and conditioning of analog signals so that later they would be read by the ESP32 and displayed on a local server within the memory of the ESP32, so that several devices could access through the IP simultaneously.
